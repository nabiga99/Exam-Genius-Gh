I'll create a file called `django_instructions.txt` with the Django implementation guide.


I apologize for the error. Let me try creating the file using a different approach:

```bash

```
I apologize for the confusion. Let's try another approach by creating the file with a simpler tool:

I apologize for the difficulties. It seems we don't have access to file creation tools. Let me provide you with the content that you can copy and save as `django_instructions.txt`:

# Implementing Django for the Exam Genius Ghana Backend

## Step-by-Step Implementation Guide

### 1. Set Up Your Development Environment

1. **Install Python**
   - Install Python 3.8+ from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - Ensure Python is added to your system PATH

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**
   - Create a virtual environment to isolate dependencies
   - Use `venv` or `virtualenv` to create the environment
   - Activate the virtual environment before proceeding

3. **Install Django and Dependencies**
   - Install Django using pip
   - Install additional packages: djangorestframework, django-cors-headers, psycopg2 (for PostgreSQL)
   - Consider using a requirements.txt file to track dependencies

### 2. Create the Django Project Structure

1. **Start a New Django Project**
   - Use Django's command-line utility to create a new project
   - Place the project in a backend directory separate from your React frontend

2. **Create Django Apps**
   - Create separate apps for different functionalities:
     - `users`: Authentication and user management
     - `curriculum`: Manage subjects, strands, and learning indicators
     - `questions`: Question generation and management
     - `documents`: Document management (teacher manuals)

3. **Configure Settings**
   - Update settings.py with database configuration
   - Configure CORS settings to allow requests from frontend
   - Set up authentication (Django REST auth or similar)
   - Configure static and media files storage

### 3. Design the Database Models

1. **User Model**
   - Extend Django's built-in User model with teacher-specific fields
   - Include school information, subjects taught, etc.

2. **Curriculum Models**
   - Create models for educational levels, classes, subjects
   - Create models for strands, sub-strands, learning indicators
   - Establish relationships between curriculum elements

3. **Document Models**
   - Create models for teacher manuals
   - Store file paths, metadata, and categorization info

4. **Question Models**
   - Create models for question sets and individual questions
   - Support different question types (MCQ, True/False, etc.)
   - Store relationships to curriculum elements

5. **Run Migrations**
   - Create and apply migrations to set up the database schema

### 4. Implement Django REST Framework API

1. **Create Serializers**
   - Define serializers for each model to convert between Python and JSON
   - Include nested serializers where appropriate

2. **Build ViewSets and Views**
   - Create ViewSets for CRUD operations on models
   - Implement custom views for complex operations
   - Add filtering, pagination, and search capabilities

3. **Define URL Patterns**
   - Configure URL routing for API endpoints
   - Use namespaced URLs for better organization
   - Include versioning in the API structure

4. **Implement Permissions**
   - Set up permission classes to control access
   - Ensure users can only access their own data
   - Create admin-specific permissions

### 5. Implement Authentication

1. **Configure Django REST Auth**
   - Set up token-based authentication
   - Implement refresh tokens for security
   - Create login, registration, and password reset endpoints

2. **Add JWT Support**
   - Implement JWT for secure API communication
   - Configure token expiration and refresh policies

3. **Set Up Social Authentication (Optional)**
   - Add support for Google, Microsoft, or other providers
   - Link social accounts to user profiles

### 6. Build Core Functionality

1. **Curriculum Management**
   - Create endpoints to retrieve curriculum data
   - Implement filtering to get relevant curriculum elements

2. **Document Management**
   - Create endpoints for uploading and retrieving teacher manuals
   - Implement document categorization and search

3. **Question Generation**
   - Build a service layer to handle AI integration
   - Create endpoints to request and retrieve generated questions
   - Implement caching for better performance

4. **Question Set Management**
   - Create endpoints for saving, editing, and organizing questions
   - Implement export functionality (Word documents)

### 7. Implement Advanced Features

1. **Background Tasks**
   - Use Celery for handling long-running tasks
   - Queue question generation tasks to improve user experience

2. **Caching**
   - Implement Redis or Memcached for caching frequently accessed data
   - Cache curriculum and document metadata

3. **File Storage**
   - Configure Django to use AWS S3 or similar for storing documents
   - Implement secure file access controls

4. **Analytics**
   - Track question generation statistics
   - Collect usage metrics for improvement

### 8. Testing and Quality Assurance

1. **Write Tests**
   - Create unit tests for models and business logic
   - Write integration tests for API endpoints
   - Test authentication and permissions

2. **Set Up CI/CD**
   - Configure GitHub Actions or similar for continuous integration
   - Automate testing and deployment

### 9. Connect Frontend to Backend

1. **Update API Calls**
   - Modify your React frontend to use the Django API
   - Update authentication methods in the frontend

2. **Handle CORS**
   - Ensure proper CORS configuration on both ends
   - Test cross-origin requests

3. **Implement Authentication Flow**
   - Update login/logout functions to use Django auth endpoints
   - Store and refresh tokens appropriately

### 10. Deployment Preparation

1. **Configure Production Settings**
   - Create separate settings for development and production
   - Set up environment variables for sensitive information

2. **Prepare Database**
   - Set up PostgreSQL for production
   - Configure database backups

3. **Static Files**
   - Configure static files collection and serving
   - Set up a CDN if needed

4. **Containerization (Optional)**
   - Create Docker files for containerized deployment
   - Configure Docker Compose for local development

### 11. Deployment

1. **Choose Hosting Provider**
   - Select a provider that supports Django (Heroku, DigitalOcean, AWS)
   - Consider using managed PostgreSQL services

2. **Deploy Backend**
   - Follow provider-specific deployment instructions
   - Set up SSL certificates for secure connections

3. **Set Up Domain and DNS**
   - Configure domain to point to your backend
   - Set up API subdomain if needed

4. **Monitor and Scale**
   - Implement monitoring and logging
   - Configure auto-scaling if necessary

### 12. Documentation and Maintenance

1. **Create API Documentation**
   - Use Swagger or ReDoc to document your API
   - Include usage examples

2. **Establish Backup Procedures**
   - Set up regular database backups
   - Create disaster recovery plans

3. **Implement Monitoring**
   - Set up uptime monitoring
   - Configure error tracking (Sentry or similar)

## Key Considerations for Your Django Backend

- **Security**: Implement proper authentication, permissions, and data validation
- **Performance**: Use caching, database optimization, and efficient queries
- **Scalability**: Design the system to handle growth in users and content
- **Maintainability**: Follow Django best practices and coding standards
- **Documentation**: Document your API and codebase thoroughly
