In the generation process this is what i want it to be like:
-I will upload all the necessary docs (sylabus, curriculum, teachings notes, learner materials, etc) for a particular subject. which means each subject will have its set of documents to refer to when generating the questions about that particular subject.
There should be a way that the AI model should read the contents on those files and have a full understanding of what is in them.
- The strands, and sub strands of each subject will be populated 
- when a user selects, the level (either JHS or SHS) and the class (BS&, BS8, BS9, SHS1, SHS2 or SHS3), then the next field should be a field to select the subject associated with that selected level and class.
After that the strands will follow, after selecting the strand, the sub strand will also follow to be selected.
- When all is done, the information gathered will be passed into the prompt that will allow the questions to be generated
-The document upload section will be replaced by the first step



now reactivate the file upload section on the question generation page but these changes should be made.
a file (teacher manual) must be attached to a class, so when a class is selected, the file attached to that class and selected subject must populate.
After that, that file must be passed into the API call to generate the questions.
The API call must read through the entire file to understand and then generate the questions based on that file, with the options selected and passed into the API call. the prompt must be updated as such.

also on after the questions are generated, the pdf and json export  must be removed leaving the docx export option (NB: it should be exported as docx not doc)
